I’ll prepare an in-depth report covering everything you should consider when prompting an AI agent in a 3JS sandbox.dev environment to build a game. This will include game type considerations, scene structure, gameplay logic, and a comprehensive overview of asset types and file formats you can provide or generate.\n\nI’ll let you know as soon as the report is ready.\nBuilding a Three.js Game: Key Considerations and Assets\n\nThree.js is a popular JavaScript library for creating 3D experiences in the browser. Using Three.js to build a game (especially via an AI coding assistant) requires careful planning of your game’s design, the “vibe”, and the assets you will provide. This in-depth report outlines the main considerations, types of game scenarios possible, and the various asset types (and file formats) you should be aware of when prompting an AI to create a Three.js game.\n\nPlanning the Game Concept and Design\n\nBefore diving into assets and code, clearly define the game concept and vibe you want. Three.js can power a wide range of game genres, so decide on the type of game and the desired look and feel:\n\nGame Genre/Perspective: Will it be a first-person shooter, a third-person adventure, a racing game, a platformer, a puzzle, or something else? Three.js has been used for everything from pinball-style arcade games to futuristic racing games\nhenryegloff.com\nhenryegloff.com\n. The genre determines many requirements (e.g. a racing game needs track and vehicle models; a first-person game might need weapons and maze or level geometry, etc.). Be specific about the game’s perspective (first-person camera vs. third-person follow camera vs. top-down, etc.) and core mechanics (e.g. racing laps, shooting targets, solving puzzles).\n\nVisual Style and Mood: Consider the art style and atmosphere you want to convey. Is the game realistic, cartoonish, low-poly, or retro pixelated? The vibe can affect choices of lighting, textures, and models. Mention the desired mood in your prompt (e.g. “dark and spooky dungeon” vs. “bright and colorful candy land”). Remember that textures and colors play a crucial role in creating depth and mood in a scene\nmoldstud.com\n. Lighting choices will also set the atmosphere (warm sunlight for a happy feel, dim lights and shadows for horror, neon glows for sci-fi, etc.). Three.js offers various light types (ambient, directional, point, spotlights, etc.), each contributing uniquely to the scene’s atmosphere\nmoldstud.com\nmoldstud.com\n, so you can specify if the scene is mainly sun-lit, has dynamic lights (like a flashlight or street lamps), etc.\n\nGame Objective and Mechanics: Outline what the player needs to do (e.g. reach the end of a level, score points by collecting items, defeat enemies, survive as long as possible, etc.). This helps determine what interactive elements and logic the game requires. For example, if the goal is to collect objects, you’ll need collectible item models and code for picking them up; if there are enemies, you need enemy models and basic AI behavior, etc. Defining win/lose conditions in the prompt ensures the AI sets up appropriate game logic.\n\nControls and User Input: Clarify how the player will control the game. For instance, will the player use keyboard (WASD for movement, space to jump), mouse (for camera look or clicking), or touch controls (for mobile)? If it’s a first-person or third-person game, mention using pointer lock controls or orbit controls as needed. Defining the control scheme in the prompt ensures the AI agent codes the correct event listeners for input. For example, you might prompt: “Player can move with WASD keys and look around with the mouse; pressing spacebar makes the character jump.”\n\nTechnical Considerations in Three.js\n\nWhen building a game with Three.js (even via AI), it helps to be aware of the core technical components. A Three.js game scene typically consists of the following key elements\nmoldstud.com\n:\n\nScene Setup: A THREE.Scene() to hold all 3D objects.\n\nCamera: A camera (e.g. PerspectiveCamera) that defines the viewpoint. The camera’s position and movement (or attachment to a player object) will determine what the player sees.\n\nRenderer: A WebGL renderer to draw the scene. The renderer needs to be added to the DOM and updated each frame.\n\nLighting: Without lights, 3D objects appear dark or flat. You’ll likely need at least some light in the scene (ambient light to globally illuminate, plus directional or point lights for shadows and highlights). Proper illumination prevents even detailed models from looking flat\nmoldstud.com\n. For beginners, starting with a soft ambient light ensures everything is visible\nmoldstud.com\n, and you can add directional light (like a sun) or spotlights for effect.\n\nObjects and Models: The 3D meshes (characters, environment, items) added to the scene. These can be primitive shapes or imported models (more on asset types below).\n\nGame Loop (Animation Frame): An update loop (requestAnimationFrame) to animate the scene and update game logic every frame\nmoldstud.com\n. In this loop, you handle movements, collisions, AI updates, and call renderer.render(scene, camera) each frame.\n\nControls/Interaction Handlers: Code for user inputs (keyboard events, mouse moves or clicks, touch events). Three.js has add-ons like OrbitControls or PointerLockControls for camera, but you may also implement custom control logic. The prompt should specify if such controls are needed (e.g. “use PointerLockControls for first-person navigation” or “use OrbitControls to allow the player to look around with the mouse”).\n\nIt’s important to note that Three.js is primarily a rendering library, not a full game engine. It does not include features like physics or networking built-in\nblog.logrocket.com\n. This means if your game needs realistic physics (gravity, collisions, rigid bodies), you should consider using a physics library (e.g. Cannon.js, Ammo.js, or Rapier for 3D physics) or simplifying physics with basic collision detection in code. Similarly, if you wanted multiplayer, that would require additional networking code beyond Three.js (but for most prompts, you can focus on single-player to keep it simpler).\n\nPerformance considerations are also crucial in a Three.js game:\n\nKeep the polygon count of models reasonable (use low-poly models for less powerful devices). Web games often favor low-poly or optimized models that still look good. For instance, the official Three.js examples include low-poly animated models that run smoothly even on mobile\ndiscoverthreejs.com\n.\n\nLimit the number of light sources with shadows or expensive effects, as these can reduce frame rate. Often one or two dynamic lights with shadows (like the sun or a flashlight) are used, and others are ambient or hemisphere lights without shadows for general illumination.\n\nUse efficient textures (avoid very large images if not needed, or use compressed texture formats or resizing). A 1024×1024 texture may be sufficient instead of a 4096×4096, for example, to save memory.\n\nLeverage frustum culling (Three.js does this by default) and possibly levels of detail (LOD) if you have lots of distant objects. In large scenes, you might only load or activate portions of the world as needed (though implementing that can be complex – but mention if the game world is large or infinite and maybe the AI can incorporate a simple solution).\n\nIf the game is simple, the AI can likely handle it fine. For more complex games, consider breaking the prompt into steps (e.g., “first set up basic environment and movement, then we’ll add X feature”). However, sandbox AI agents often attempt everything in one go, so a comprehensive initial prompt covering all major points is beneficial.\n\nAssets for a Three.js Game\n\nOne advantage of Three.js is that it’s asset-agnostic – you can include any models, images, or media you have, as long as you use the appropriate loaders. When prompting an AI to build the game, you should list and provide the assets you want it to use. Here are the different types of assets and file formats typically involved:\n\n3D Models (Geometry and Meshes): These are the most important assets – your characters, vehicles, props, environment models, etc. Three.js supports loading various 3D model formats via loaders. The glTF/GLB format (GL Transmission Format) is highly recommended for Three.js and web usage\ndiscoverthreejs.com\n. glTF is often called “the JPEG of 3D” and is now the de facto standard for web 3D assets, because it is efficient in size and can contain all necessary data (meshes, materials, textures, animations) in one file\ndiscoverthreejs.com\ndiscoverthreejs.com\n. If possible, use glTF 2.0 models (binary .glb is ideal for compactness). Three.js has a built-in GLTFLoader to handle this format easily.\n\nOther formats you might encounter include:\n\nOBJ + MTL: Wavefront OBJ models (with a .obj mesh and a .mtl material file) – these only support geometry and basic materials (no animations). Three.js can load OBJs with OBJLoader, but you must also load/apply the MTL for materials.\n\nFBX: A popular format for many modeling tools. Three.js’s FBXLoader can load FBX, including animations, but FBX is a proprietary format and can have interoperability issues\ndiscourse.threejs.org\n. glTF is generally preferred for reliability and speed (glTF parsing is lighter weight than FBX parsing in Three.js\ndiscourse.threejs.org\n).\n\nCollada (.dae): An older XML-based format. Three.js has a ColladaLoader if needed.\n\nOthers: Three.js can also import STL (for static models), or VRML, etc., but these are rarer for games. If using Blender or Maya, you can export to glTF directly (or FBX and then convert). Many asset stores now provide glTF downloads. In summary, try to provide glTF/GLB models for best results (it’s “the best format for exchanging 3D assets on the web”\ndiscoverthreejs.com\n and ideal for Three.js).\n\nWhat to include in your prompt regarding models: List each model asset, its file name, and what it represents. For example: “player.glb – a rigged character model of a robot with walking animation,” or “car.fbx – sports car model,” or “tree.obj and tree.mtl – a static tree object for scenery.” This helps the AI know what it has to load and how to use it (e.g., animate the player model, or scatter tree models around the level). If the model has animations (like a walking cycle or a jump animation), mention that so the AI can trigger those animations in the game (using Three.js’s animation mixer). glTF files can contain animations and even entire scenes with lights/cameras\ndiscoverthreejs.com\n, so let the AI know if it should use those or set up its own scene.\n\nTextures and Images: Textures are 2D images applied to 3D models to give them color and detail. Common texture file types are JPEG or PNG for standard textures. You might have diffuse color maps, normal maps (for surface detail), roughness/metalness maps (if using PBR materials), etc. Provide any texture files needed and describe their purpose: e.g. “brick_diffuse.jpg – color texture for the building walls,” and “brick_normal.png – normal map for wall texture,” etc. Three.js’s materials (like MeshStandardMaterial for physically-based rendering) can use these texture maps. Also, consider environment maps if relevant: for example, a sky cubemap or an HDR equirectangular image to serve as a skybox or reflection source. If your game has an outdoor environment, you might include a skybox set (6 images forming the sky) or a single HDR sky image. Mention in the prompt if you want the sky or reflections set up (e.g. “use sky.hdr as an environment map for reflections and ambient lighting” or “apply skybox/*.jpg images to create a skybox”). Good use of textures and materials will greatly enhance the visual quality and vibe of the game world.\n\nPrompt tip: If you don’t have custom textures, you can instruct the AI to use basic colors or procedurally generate materials. For instance, “make the ground a grassy green plane” or “the enemy glows red.” But for realism, providing texture files is better. Always cite the file names in your prompt so the agent knows these assets exist.\n\nAudio Assets (Sound/Music): Sound can dramatically improve immersion. Three.js can incorporate audio by using AudioListener and Audio objects\nmoldstud.com\n. You should gather any background music tracks (in MP3 or OGG format) and sound effect files (for jumps, collisions, gunshots, etc.). Common audio formats for web are .mp3, .ogg, .wav\ndocs.unity3d.com\n. List these in your prompt if available, e.g. “background.mp3 – looping ambient music,” or “jump.wav – play this when the character jumps.” If using Three.js audio, remember to mention attaching the audio to the camera or scene, and playing it at appropriate times. The AI can load audio files via Three.js’s AudioLoader or simpler HTML5 Audio. Example: “Add background music (background.mp3) that starts playing on loop, and a coin.wav sound that plays when a coin is collected.” – This tells the AI to integrate those audio assets. Including audio adds a whole new layer of depth to your scene, making it more immersive\nmoldstud.com\n.\n\nAnimations (Rigged Models or Keyframes): If your game involves characters or moving models with predefined animations (running, jumping, walking cycles, etc.), these are usually embedded in the 3D model file (glTF or FBX can contain animation data). Ensure any animated model is noted as such. For instance, if you have a glTF with an animation, mention “the model includes animations for idle and walk.” The AI can then use Three.js’s animation system to play those (e.g. using an AnimationMixer). If you have separate animation files or sprite sheets (less common in 3D Three.js; those are more for 2D), include them as needed. For simpler games, you might not have complex animations – maybe just moving objects via code – but if you do, let the AI know.\n\nEnvironmental Assets: Think about the game world’s environment. This could include:\n\nTerrain – Are you using a heightmap image to generate terrain, or a premade terrain model? If a heightmap, it’s essentially a texture (grayscale image) that can be used to displace a plane. If a premade model, treat it like any 3D model asset.\n\nSky – As mentioned, a skybox or sky texture if needed.\n\nBillboards/Particles – If your game uses particle effects (fire, smoke, rain), you might use small texture sprites for particles. The AI can also generate basic particles via Three.js’s Points or use a sprite with transparency. If you have a specific particle texture (like a flame or spark sprite image), include it.\n\nUI/HUD Elements: Although Three.js is 3D, many games have 2D overlays for score, health, etc. These could be simple HTML/CSS overlays, or drawn using 2D canvas, or even as textured planes in the 3D scene. If you have any image assets for UI (like an icon, or a font for text), list them. Otherwise, you can instruct the AI to simply draw text on screen or use basic shapes. (For example, “display score in top-left in white text” – the AI might use a simple DOM element or a 2D canvas for that).\n\nShaders and Special Effects: If you want a very specific visual style, you might consider custom shaders or post-processing. This might be advanced to ask an AI in one go, but you could mention it if needed. For instance, “apply a bloom effect for bright areas” or “use a shader for water material to make it reflective.” Three.js has ShaderMaterial and an examples library for post-processing. If you have any shader code or want to include (say you found a specific shader online), you could provide those as asset files (e.g. water.frag.glsl). However, if you don’t have that, you can simply describe the effect and see if the AI can implement it. Make sure not to overload the prompt; these are optional considerations for enhancing the vibe.\n\nIn summary, list all assets (files) you can supply in the prompt, with clear descriptions of what they are. Three.js can load 3D models (preferably glTF/GLB)\ndiscoverthreejs.com\n, apply textures to them, play audio for effects or music, and render it all with proper lighting and shaders. The AI agent will use loaders (GLTFLoader, TextureLoader, AudioLoader, etc.) to import these assets. By providing the assets and describing their usage, you allow the AI to integrate them seamlessly. For example, a concise asset list in your prompt might look like:\n\nAssets:\n\nscene.glb: A complete level model containing the environment (buildings, ground, etc.).\n\nplayer.glb: Main character model (with running/jumping animations).\n\nenemy.glb: Enemy creature model (with an animation).\n\ncoin.glb: Collectible coin model.\n\nskybox_front.png, skybox_back.png, ...: Six images forming a skybox.\n\ngrass.jpg: Texture for ground.\n\ncoin.wav: Sound effect for coin pickup.\n\nbgm.mp3: Background music track.\n\nWith such a list, the AI knows what it has to work with. Always ensure the file paths or names match what the sandbox environment expects (the AI might assume a certain directory for assets; clarify if needed, like “assets are in a folder named static/”).\n\nGame Mechanics and Interactivity\n\nBeyond assets, think through the gameplay mechanics you want, and include those details in your prompt. Important considerations include:\n\nPlayer Mechanics: How does the player move or act? If it’s a character, can they run, jump, shoot, or interact with objects? If it’s a vehicle, how does it steer or accelerate? Provide the rules: e.g., “the player can jump to avoid obstacles” or “the spaceship can shoot lasers with click.” If using physics, mention gravity (e.g. “the game has gravity so the player falls if not on ground”) and jump force, etc. For an AI-coded game, you might rely on simple gravity simulation (like moving downward each frame unless on ground) or use a physics engine if you explicitly prompt for it. Mention collision handling: for example, “end the game if the player collides with an enemy,” or “collectibles disappear and increment score when touched by the player.” The agent can implement basic bounding-box or distance-based collision checks for these.\n\nEnemy and NPC Behavior: If your game has enemies or non-player characters, describe their behavior. Is it simple (move toward the player, or move along a set path) or complex (patrol, chase, attack)? The prompt could say “Add 3 enemy robots that wander within the arena and chase the player if close.” This signals the need for some AI logic. Keep behaviors simple for the AI to implement (random movement, direct chase, etc., rather than something too advanced, unless you plan to refine it step by step).\n\nGame Loop and Difficulty: Mention if the game should have levels or increasing difficulty. For example, “after collecting 10 coins, advance to the next level with faster enemies,” or “the game should get harder over time (enemies spawn more frequently).” The agent can then include a mechanism for progression. If it’s an endless game (like an infinite runner), clarify that too (“game ends when player hits an obstacle, otherwise continues indefinitely with increasing speed”).\n\nScore and UI: If the game involves scoring, health, or other stats, decide how to display them. You can instruct: “Show the player’s health and score on screen. The player starts with 3 lives.” The AI might create a simple HTML overlay or draw text via Three.js. Also define conditions like “if health reaches 0, display Game Over and reset the game or allow restart.”\n\nCamera Dynamics: We touched on perspective earlier, but also consider if the camera should do something special. For example, in a third-person game, the camera might follow the player at a certain angle; in a platformer, it might be fixed or side-scrolling following the character. If first-person, the camera is essentially the player’s eyes. State any specifics like “camera follows slightly behind and above the player” or “camera remains at a fixed angle overlooking the scene.”\n\nControls and Feedback: Ensure you specify how the game responds to inputs. For instance, “pressing ‘P’ pauses the game” or “clicking an object picks it up.” If haptic feedback or other output is relevant (in web, usually not except maybe vibration on mobile), you could mention it, but it’s uncommon. Focus on the main control scheme as mentioned earlier.\n\nPhysics and Collisions: If your game needs realistic physics (e.g. a driving game with car suspension, or objects that bounce and tumble), you might prompt the AI to include a physics engine. For example, “Use Cannon.js physics so the car has realistic movement and collisions.” That is a tall order for an AI to implement perfectly, but it might try. Alternatively, you can simplify: “simulate basic physics for jumping and gravity.” The agent can handle gravity by reducing Y velocity each frame and collision by stopping the fall when hitting ground geometry, etc. For collisions, Three.js doesn’t have built-in collision detection, but one can use bounding boxes or spheres (via THREE.Box3().intersectsBox() etc.). You can mention: “use simple bounding box collisions for player and obstacles.” This tells the AI not to ignore collisions.\n\nEdge Cases and Polish: Think if there are other features to mention: e.g., restart mechanism (maybe pressing R to restart level), a start menu or instructions, or any particle effects on certain events (like an explosion effect when something happens). These might be extras; include them if you feel they are essential to your vision. For instance: “when the enemy is defeated, play explosion sound and show a brief particle explosion effect.”\n\nBy detailing the mechanics in the prompt, the AI will have a blueprint of the game logic to implement alongside setting up the scene and assets. Essentially, you’re writing a mini game design document into the prompt – covering what the game is and how it should behave in addition to listing the assets.\n\nPrompting the AI Agent Effectively\n\nFinally, let’s summarize how to structure your prompt for the AI (such as the sandbox.dev agent using the Three.js stack):\n\nStart with a High-Level Overview: Begin the prompt with one or two sentences describing what the game is (“a 3D first-person maze exploration game” or “a simple 3D car racing game with one track and timed laps”). This gives context.\n\nList the Assets and Their Roles: As discussed, enumerate the assets you will provide. For each asset file, note what it is and how to use it. This can be a bullet list in the prompt for clarity. (The AI might not literally copy the list into code comments, but it will understand it). By clearly mapping assets to game elements, you avoid ambiguity. For example:\n\n“maze.glb – 3D model of the maze layout (walls and floor). Use this as the level geometry.”\n\n“player.glb – Animated model for the player character. Use third-person camera following this model.”\n\n“monster.glb – Enemy creature model with idle and run animations.”\n\n“key.png – Texture image for a key item pickup.”\n\n“bgm.ogg – background music to loop.”\n\netc.\n\nDescribe the Setup and Environment: Instruct how to set up the scene. E.g., “Add a skybox using the provided images to create an outdoor environment. Light the scene with a directional light (sunlight) at noon and an ambient light for general illumination. The ground should use grass.jpg texture on a plane if not already part of the model.” If the environment is part of a model (e.g., you have a full level model), then you can skip adding ground plane separately – just clarify what’s needed. If you want fog for atmospheric effect, mention that (“enable a slight fog in the scene for distance”).\n\nDefine the Game Mechanics in Steps: It helps to enumerate the gameplay requirements:\n\nPlayer movement and controls (e.g., “Player can move with WASD and look with mouse”).\n\nPlayer abilities (e.g., “Player can press space to jump” or “click to shoot, which spawns a projectile”).\n\nEnemies or hazards (e.g., “There are 5 enemy objects that patrol. If the player collides with an enemy, decrease health by 1.”).\n\nCollectibles or goals (e.g., “Player must collect 3 keys (objects in the maze). When all keys are collected, unlock the exit door.”).\n\nWin/Lose conditions (e.g., “If player reaches the exit, display ‘You Win!’; If health drops to 0, game over message.”).\n\nUI feedback (e.g., “Show health and keys collected on screen.”).\n\nWriting these as a clear list in the prompt ensures the agent doesn’t miss any major feature. It’s essentially scripting the game’s rules for the AI to implement.\n\nMention Any Specific Three.js APIs or Libraries: If you know certain Three.js utilities should be used, you can mention them. For example, “use GLTFLoader to load models” (the agent likely will anyway), or “use OrbitControls so the user can rotate the camera freely around the scene,” or “integrate Cannon.js for realistic physics on the car.” If using a physics library, the environment (like sandbox.dev) needs to have it available or you provide it. If uncertain, you can ask the AI to use a simple physics fallback. But if the platform allows it, being specific helps. Another example: “use Three.js AudioListener and Audio to play sounds.” The agent should then know to attach an AudioListener to the camera and load sounds accordingly.\n\nKeep the Prompt Organized and Clear: Use paragraphs or bullet points (depending on how the sandbox agent accepts input) to separate concerns. The clearer and more structured the prompt, the better the AI can translate it into structured code. Essentially, mirror much of what we’ve discussed (concept, assets, setup, mechanics) in a well-ordered way. This reduces back-and-forth. Remember that the AI will follow your instructions quite literally, so double-check that nothing is contradictory or ambiguous.\n\nBe Mindful of Complexity: If the game idea is very complex, consider building it in iterations with multiple prompts. But if using one prompt, prioritize the core features first (it’s better to have a working basic game than an attempt at everything that might end up buggy). You can always refine or add details in follow-up prompts to the agent.\n\nExamples of Game Types and Asset Needs\n\nTo spark some ideas, here are a few game genre examples and the typical assets/considerations for each:\n\nFirst-Person Maze or Shooter: (e.g., player navigates a maze or arena, possibly shooting enemies) – Assets: level geometry (maze walls, floor), a weapon model (or just use the camera as the “gun”), enemy models if any, pickup items (ammo, keys, etc.), UI for health/ammo. Considerations: use PointerLockControls for mouse look, raycasting for bullets or simple projectile objects, collision detection with walls and enemies, maybe muzzle flash or bullet impact effects as a nice extra.\n\nThird-Person Platformer/Adventure: (e.g., controlling a character who jumps between platforms) – Assets: a character model with run/jump animations, platform and terrain models (or generate platforms as simple boxes), maybe enemy or obstacle models, collectible items (coins, etc.), background scenery (trees, buildings), and sound effects (jump, coin, etc.). Considerations: third-person camera follow, gravity and jump physics, platform collision so the player stands on them, a scoring or level progression system.\n\nRacing/Driving Game: – Assets: one or more vehicle models, track model or pieces of track (could be a single model of a circuit, or constructed from road segments), environment objects (landscape, buildings, skybox), maybe UI elements (speedometer or lap timer). Considerations: driving physics (steering, acceleration – can be simplified or use a physics engine for realism), camera either third-person chase cam or perhaps first-person dashboard view, lap counting or race time logic, reset if car flips (unless using physics that handles it), and background music for intensity. Including engine sound loops could also add realism.\n\n3D Puzzle or Casual Game: (e.g., 3D Tetris or a Rubik’s cube, or a marble maze) – Assets: depends on the concept; could be geometric shapes, maybe minimal textures, possibly some UI. Considerations: focus on the core puzzle mechanics (like shape fitting logic or physics for a marble rolling), camera might be fixed or user-rotatable to view the puzzle, and gentle ambient sound or feedback sounds for actions.\n\nVirtual Reality Experience: If you were to target VR (WebXR) using Three.js, assets would be similar to a first-person game, but the considerations (like using WebXR camera, controllers input) are very specific. Since the question didn’t explicitly ask for VR, just be aware that Three.js can also create VR games, but you would explicitly prompt the use of WebXR if so (and ensure the sandbox environment supports it). In a VR game, assets might include 3D hand controller models, 360-degree environment, etc., which are beyond a basic use case.\n\nEach game type will shape your prompt’s content. The key is: identify what assets are needed and what systems (controls, physics, UI, etc.) are involved, and communicate each in the prompt. The more thorough your plan, the better the AI can deliver a consistent result.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, building a Three.js game via AI “vibe coding” means you provide the creative vision and ingredients, and the AI handles the code assembly. Always consider the game design, visual/style goals, asset preparation, and technical requirements in advance. Three.js is a powerful 3D library that, with the right assets and instructions, can produce anything from simple interactive scenes to full games running in the browser. By accounting for game type, necessary assets (3D models, textures, audio, etc.), and implementation details (controls, mechanics, lighting, and performance), you can craft a prompt that guides the AI to create a cohesive game.\n\nRemember to leverage efficient formats like glTF for models (as it’s the best format for web 3D assets\ndiscoverthreejs.com\n and can contain entire scenes and animations\ndiscoverthreejs.com\n), use descriptive detail for the vibe (so the atmosphere comes out right), and include all relevant asset files (models, images, sounds) with clear descriptions. With all these considerations in place, you’ll set the stage for the AI agent to successfully build your envisioned 3D game in Three.js. Good luck, and enjoy the creative process of “vibe coding” your game!"}

It covers game types suitable for the platform, essential assets to provide, and detailed prompting strategies to maximize development efficiency and quality.\n\n## Part 1: Game Types & Scope Considerations\n\n### Ideal Game Categories for Three.js\n\nThree.js excels at certain game types due to its web-based nature and rendering capabilities. Here are the most suitable categories:\n\n**Casual & Arcade Games**\nThese games work exceptionally well due to their simple mechanics and moderate performance requirements. Examples include endless runners, puzzle games, match-3 variants in 3D space, and physics-based games like marble runs or ball-rolling challenges. The lightweight nature of these games ensures smooth performance across devices.\n\n**Exploration & Walking Simulators**\nThree.js handles atmospheric experiences beautifully. Consider first-person exploration games, museum or gallery walkthroughs, educational tours, and ambient narrative experiences. These games can leverage Three.js's strong lighting and material capabilities without demanding complex physics.\n\n**Strategy & Board Games**\nTurn-based games work particularly well since they don't require intense real-time calculations. Options include 3D chess or checkers, tower defense games, city builders with simplified mechanics, and card games with 3D elements. The controlled pace allows for more complex visual effects without performance concerns.\n\n**Racing & Vehicle Games**\nSimple racing games perform well, especially arcade-style racers, time trials, obstacle courses, and flight simulators with basic physics. Keep the number of simultaneous vehicles limited for optimal performance.\n\n**Puzzle & Logic Games**\n3D puzzles leverage spatial reasoning effectively. Consider spatial rotation puzzles, block-stacking games, maze navigation, and physics puzzles. These games can focus on visual polish since gameplay mechanics are typically straightforward.\n\n### Games to Approach Cautiously\n\nSome game types present challenges in Three.js. Open-world games with vast terrains require careful optimization. Multiplayer real-time combat games need robust networking solutions. Complex simulation games may hit performance limits. High-fidelity FPS games might struggle with browser limitations.\n\n## Part 2: Essential Assets to Provide\n\n### 3D Models\n\n**Format Specifications**\nProvide models in GLTF/GLB format for optimal compatibility. Keep polygon counts reasonable - under 50k for hero assets, under 10k for environmental props, and under 5k for background elements. Include LOD (Level of Detail) variations for important models.\n\n**Model Categories to Prepare**\n- Character models with clear topology and rigging if animated\n- Environmental assets like buildings, terrain pieces, and vegetation\n- Interactive objects with clear pivot points\n- Particle effect meshes for optimization\n- UI elements in 3D space if applicable\n\n**Technical Considerations**\nEnsure proper UV mapping for texturing. Keep consistent scale across all models. Center pivots appropriately for rotation and positioning. Name objects clearly in the hierarchy. Separate meshes that need independent animation or interaction.\n\n### Textures & Materials\n\n**Texture Types**\nProvide diffuse/albedo maps for base colors, normal maps for surface detail, roughness/metalness maps for PBR workflows, ambient occlusion for enhanced realism, and emission maps for glowing elements. Consider providing texture atlases for optimization.\n\n**Resolution Guidelines**\nUse 2048x2048 for hero assets, 1024x1024 for standard props, 512x512 for distant or small objects. Always provide power-of-two dimensions. Include compressed formats for web delivery.\n\n### Audio Assets\n\n**Sound Categories**\n- Background music loops with seamless points\n- Ambient soundscapes for atmosphere\n- UI sounds for clicks, hovers, and transitions\n- Gameplay sound effects with variations\n- Character voices or vocalizations\n- Environmental audio for immersion\n\n**Format Specifications**\nProvide MP3 for broad compatibility and OGG for better compression. Keep file sizes optimized for web delivery. Include multiple variations of repetitive sounds. Ensure consistent volume levels across assets.\n\n### Animation Data\n\n**Character Animations**\nInclude idle cycles, movement animations (walk, run, jump), action animations specific to gameplay, transition animations between states, and facial animations if applicable.\n\n**Environmental Animations**\nPrepare loops for ambient movement, triggered animations for interactions, physics-based animation parameters, and procedural animation guidelines.\n\n## Part 3: Comprehensive Prompting Strategies\n\n### Initial Project Setup Prompt Structure\n\nYour initial prompt should establish clear project parameters. Include the game title and genre, target audience and platform considerations, core gameplay loop description, unique selling points or features, and technical constraints or requirements.\n\nExample structure:\n\"Create a 3D puzzle game called 'Crystal Maze' where players navigate through rotating maze segments to collect crystals. Target casual players on desktop and mobile browsers. Core mechanic involves rotating maze sections to create paths. Include particle effects for crystal collection and ambient fog for atmosphere. Optimize for 60 FPS on mid-range devices.\"\n\n### Detailed Gameplay Mechanics Prompting\n\nSpecify player controls and input methods, camera behavior and perspectives, collision detection requirements, scoring or progression systems, and win/lose conditions. Be explicit about physics requirements, interaction systems, and game state management.\n\nInclude specific examples: \"Player uses WASD/arrow keys for movement, mouse for camera rotation. Third-person camera follows player with smooth damping. Collision with walls stops movement, collision with crystals triggers collection animation and adds 10 points. Game ends when all crystals collected or time runs out.\"\n\n### Visual Style Direction\n\nDescribe the overall aesthetic vision, lighting mood and atmosphere, color palette and themes, level of realism versus stylization, and special effects requirements. Reference specific visual inspirations when possible.\n\nExample: \"Low-poly aesthetic with flat shading, warm sunset lighting with long shadows, purple and orange color scheme, stylized rather than realistic, particle effects for magical elements, fog for depth, and bloom for glowing crystals.\"\n\n### Level Design Specifications\n\nProvide level layouts or generation rules, difficulty progression concepts, environmental storytelling elements, interactive element placement, and secret area descriptions. Include sketches or diagrams when possible.\n\nSpecify: \"Generate levels procedurally using 10x10 grid, increase complexity every 3 levels, place crystals at maze junctions, include moving platforms after level 5, and hidden passages revealed by collecting special crystals.\"\n\n### Performance Optimization Directives\n\nInclude target frame rate and device specifications, maximum polygon count per scene, texture memory budgets, number of dynamic lights, and particle effect limitations. Specify LOD requirements and culling strategies.\n\nState clearly: \"Maintain 60 FPS on devices with 4GB RAM, maximum 100k polygons visible at once, use baked lighting where possible, limit to 3 dynamic lights, implement frustum culling, and use LOD for models beyond 50 units distance.\"\n\n### UI/UX Specifications\n\nDetail menu systems and navigation, HUD elements and positioning, feedback systems for player actions, tutorial or onboarding flow, and accessibility considerations.\n\nDescribe: \"Main menu with 3D animated background, HUD showing score, time, and crystals collected in top corners, screen shake on collision, glow effect on interactable objects, and step-by-step tutorial for first level.\"\n\n## Part 4: Asset Preparation Checklist\n\n### Pre-Development Checklist\n\nBefore initiating development, ensure you have:\n\n**3D Models**\n- All character models rigged and tested\n- Environmental assets with proper colliders\n- Props organized by category\n- LOD versions prepared\n- Naming conventions documented\n\n**Textures**\n- Complete texture sets for all models\n- Compressed versions for web\n- Texture atlases where appropriate\n- Consistent resolution standards\n- Normal maps baked and tested\n\n**Audio**\n- Background music loops verified\n- Sound effects categorized\n- Volume levels normalized\n- Format compatibility checked\n- Silence trimmed from files\n\n**Documentation**\n- Game design document\n- Asset naming conventions\n- Technical specifications\n- Style guide with references\n- Performance targets defined\n\n### Prompt Enhancement Techniques\n\n**Use Specific Technical Terms**\nInstead of \"make it glow,\" specify \"add emissive material with bloom post-processing effect at intensity 2.0.\"\n\n**Provide Mathematical Constraints**\nRather than \"jump high,\" specify \"jump velocity of 15 units per second with gravity of -9.8.\"\n\n**Include Behavioral Pseudocode**\nFor complex mechanics, provide logic flow: \"IF player presses space AND is_grounded THEN apply upward velocity AND play jump sound AND trigger dust particles.\"\n\n**Reference Existing Games**\n\"Combat system similar to Dark Souls with stamina management\" provides clearer context than lengthy descriptions.\n\n**Specify State Machines**\nDefine game states clearly: \"MENU -> PLAYING -> PAUSED -> GAME_OVER with specific transitions and conditions.\"\n\n## Part 5: Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n### Asset-Related Issues\n\nDon't provide assets without optimization - raw exports from 3D software often need cleanup. Avoid inconsistent scales across models. Don't forget collision meshes for physics. Ensure textures are web-optimized. Include fallbacks for missing assets.\n\n### Prompt Clarity Problems\n\nAvoid vague descriptions like \"make it fun\" without specific mechanics. Don't assume the agent knows unstated requirements. Be explicit about performance constraints. Specify browser compatibility needs. Include mobile touch controls if needed.\n\n### Scope Management\n\nStart with core mechanics before adding features. Limit initial scope to ensure completion. Plan for iterative development. Consider loading times and initial download size. Account for varying device capabilities.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSuccess in Three.js game development through AI agents depends on thorough preparation and clear communication. Provide comprehensive assets in optimized formats, write detailed prompts with specific technical requirements, and maintain realistic scope for web-based deployment. Focus on game types that leverage Three.js's strengths while respecting browser limitations. With proper asset preparation and structured prompting, you can efficiently create engaging 3D web games that run smoothly across devices.\n\nRemember that iterative refinement is key - start with core functionality, test thoroughly, and gradually add complexity based on performance benchmarks and user feedback. The combination of well-prepared assets and precise prompting will enable your AI agent to produce high-quality, performant Three.js games that delight players while maintaining technical excellence."}
